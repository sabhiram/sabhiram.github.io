Options:
    start  = true | false(default)  - Begin the quote plugin if start == true
    color  = css color              - Set the border color to "color" if set,
                                      else the CSS default is used
    author = name of author         - If present, extra space is taken below
                                      the quote to tag the author. Uses a CSS
                                      :after tag

Description:
    1. Define the outer container if "include.start" is set:
        a. First, setup the outer containers class, and inject other class
           attributes which we have received via the input.var parameters.
           At the very least, the container requires the "blog-quote" class.

        b. If the "include.author" is set, inject the "blog-quote-has-author"
           class. This allows us to size the container appropriately from our
           CSS.

        c. Because the "attr" property will only work against the content CSS
           property, we need to manually setup the style for the border color
           if it is specified by the user

        d. If the quote has an author, inject a div with class
           "blog-quote-author" and put the authors name in it

    2. If "include.start" is not set, it is assumed that we wish to "end"
       this tag group with a </div>
