<!--
    Define the outer container if "include.start" is set:

        First, setup the outer containers class, and inject other class attributes which
        we have received via the input.var parameters. At the very least, the container
        requires the "blog-quote" class.

        If the "include.author" is set, inject the "blog-quote-has-author" class. This
        allows us to size the container appropriately from our CSS.

        Because the "attr" property will only work against the content property, we need
        to manually setup the style for the border color if it is specified

        If the quote has an author:

            Inject a div with class "blog-quote-author" and put the authors name in it

    If "include.start" is not set, it is assumed that we wish to "end" this tag
    group with a </div>.

    Note: We capture the "container_class" appended with the new class we wish to add
    to a temp variable, and then assign the "container_class" to "temp". For some reason
    we cannot assign "container_class" to something appended to it.
