## Fluency

<ol start="0">
    <li>Fluently speak body language.</li>
    <li>Compilers are generally better than interpreters, unless you need something promptly.</li>
    <li>Interpreters are better than compilers, unless you need something fast.</li>
    <li>For work: C/C++, Python, and the occasional JS for some goofy frontend tool.</li>
    <li>For play: Golang, Python, C++, Solidity, JS.</li>
    <li>Operating system agnostic, once you build drivers for windows - anything is fun and easy.</li>
</ol>

## Preferences

<ol start="0">
    <li>Ask for forgiveness rather than permission.</li>
    <li>Drive fast, driver faster.</li>
    <li>Compilers are good at their jobs, delegate to them.</li>
    <li>Trust but verify other people's code.</li>
    <li>Treat your code as written by others.</li>
    <li>Commit often, break things, take ownership.</li>
</ol>
