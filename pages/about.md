## Fluency

0. Fluently speak body language.
1. Compilers are generally better than interpreters, unless you need something promptly.
2. Interpreters are better than compilers, unless you need something fast.
3. For work: C/C++, Python, and the occasional JS for some goofy frontend tool.
4. For play: Golang, Python, C++, Solidity, JS.
5. Operating system agnostic, once you build drivers for windows - anything is fun and easy.

## Preferences

0. Ask for forgiveness rather than permission.
1. Drive fast, driver faster.
2. Compilers are good at their jobs, delegate to them.
3. Trust but verify other people's code.
4. Treat your code as written by others.
5. Commit often, break things, take ownership.

## Opinions

0. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
